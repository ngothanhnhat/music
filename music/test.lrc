[ti:Snow (Hey Oh)]
[00:18]Come to decide that the things that I tried
[00:20]Were in my life just to get high on
[00:23]When I sit alone come get a little more known
[00:25]But I need more than myself this time
[00:28]Step from the road to the sea to the sky
[00:30]And I do believe what we rely on
[00:32]When I lay it on
[00:33]Come get to play it on
[00:34]All my life to sacrifice
[00:36]

[00:49]Now listen what I say oh
[00:53]
[00:55]When will I know that I really can't go
[00:57]To the well one more time to decide on
[01:00]When it's killing me
[01:01]When will I really see
[01:02]All that I need to look inside
[01:04]Come to believe that I better not leave
[01:07]Before I get my chance to ride
[01:09]When it's killing me
[01:10]What do I really need
[01:11]All that I need to look inside

[01:29]
[01:32]The more I see the less I know
[01:34]The more I like to let it go hey oh
[01:40]
[01:46]Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
[01:50]Where it's so white as snow
[01:55]Privately divided by a world so undecided
[01:59]And there's nowhere to go
[02:04]In between the cover of another perfect wonder
[02:09]And it's so white as snow
[02:13]Running through a field where all my tracks will
[02:16]Be concealed and there is nowhere to go
[02:20]
[02:31]When to descend to amend for a friend
[02:33]All the channels that have broken down
[02:36]Now you bring it up
[02:37]I'm gonna ring it up
[02:38]Just to hear you sing it out
[02:40]Step from the road to the sea to the sky
[02:42]And I do believe what we rely on
[02:45]When I lay it on
[02:46]Come get to play it on
[02:47]All my life to sacrifice
[02:48]
